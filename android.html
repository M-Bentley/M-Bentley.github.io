	<h1>A South Park "Where's Waldo?" inspired <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2cQgh8JzliXVUswcTBKNThLT2M/view?usp=sharing'>game.</a></h1>

	<p>The game revolves around finding the Waldo character around the screen in order to earn points as a small song plays in the background.</p>
	<p>If the start button is pressed, a tune begins playing and the characters rearrange to hide the Waldo character.</p>

	<h3>These blocks are what we used to rearrange all the characters on the screen efficiently while also updating the score counter. The list holds all of the image sprites in use, and the procedure block streamlines the processes used in rearranging the positions of them all.</h3>
	<h4>Reflections:</h4><p>Although we had to abandon our original concept for the game, we still found a way to incorporate some ideas from past projects to make something fresh that at least resembled what we had orignally set out to make.
	One of the hardest parts of the project was creating a consistent theme around our Waldo characters as well as making sure the screen oriented along with the people properly.</p>
