	<h1>An Itchy & Scracthy/Space Invaders inspired <a href='https://github.com/M-Bentley/Breakout_Arkanoid'>game.</a></h1>
	<img src="scratchyshot2.png"/>
	<p>The player is able to fire chainsaws to prevent the cats from reaching the ground.</p>
	<img src="scratchyshot1.png"/>
	<p>If the enemies are able to reach the ground the game is over.</p>
		
	
	<h2>self.image = pygame.image.load("H:\Itchy.png")
        self.image = pygame.transform.scale(self.image, (50,100))</h2>
	
	These lines are what we used to load the image into the game as well as scale the photo's size.
	<h3>Reflections: The project was alittle rocky and could have been improved on. The collisions between the saws and cats could have been refined at bit more along with the addition of a score counter or time counter. Most of the things I'd have like to have changed would be purely cosmetic.</h3>
